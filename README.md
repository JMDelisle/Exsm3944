EXSM3945 - Project
Due Date - Sept 01, 2022
Jean-Marc Delisle

-Creating an MVC from an old 3942 project * more less copy and pasting*.
-Using authentication method to create login and must login to make any changes.
-Rewatching Friday video for step 5/6.

-Fixed my issues in Controller where it was populating the website under newuser: I had copy and pasted James code top of mine where I should of copied a section.<br><br>
-Having error crashing at line 124, need to check my naming convention I think.--> Now fixed, had to use _context.SaveChanges();<br><br>
-I am trying to insert the Client Id and Fullname in place of just ClientId... for some reason it not working as per what James had showed us. <br>


-Pretty much completed for the most part other than some css I will be getting done.<br><br>
-Added some css to look a bit better than just plain white and I don't think it's too bright but comment if it is.<br><br>
